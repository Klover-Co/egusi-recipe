    <h3><u>Instructions <em>(Fried Method)</em></u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Prepare the Egusi Paste:</b> In a bowl, mix the ground egusi seeds with a little water or some of the reserved<br>meat stock to form a thick, slightly lumpy paste. Set aside.</li>
        <li><b>Fry the Egusi:</b> In a large pot, heat the palm oil over medium heat. Do not let the oil bleach. Add the chopped onions and sauté<br>until translucent. Add the egusi paste in small scoops to the oil. Fry for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent<br>burning, until the egusi is fried and clumpy and the oil has separated from the mixture.</li>
        <li><b>Simmer the Soup Base:</b> Gradually add the reserved meat and fish stock to the fried egusi, stirring well to combine.<br>Add the cooked meats, stockfish, blended peppers, ground crayfish, dawadawa (if using), and seasoning cubes. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer.</li>
        <li><b>Cook and Season:</b> Cover the pot and allow it to simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br>The egusi needs to cook properly to prevent an upset stomach. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt or seasoning cubes if needed.</li>
        <li><b>Add Vegetables and Serve:</b> Add the chopped leafy greens (spinach, pumpkin leaves, or bitter leaves). Stir gently to combine.<br>Taste for salt and adjust seasoning as needed. Cook for another 3 to 5 minutes, then remove from the heat.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Serving Suggestions</h3>
    <p><em>Egusi soup is traditionally served with a West African swallow such as eba (garri), pounded yam, fufu, or semovita.
        <br>It also pairs well with white rice or boiled plantains for a comforting, filling meal.</em></p>
